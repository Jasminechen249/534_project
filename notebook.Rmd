## Jan 21, 2020 API Selection
Reviewed different APIs, discussed with Jasmine and Chris and chose the Github Events API. 

## Jan 23, 2020 Create R wrapper
Took the online mini course "An Introduction to APIs" https://zapier.com/learn/apis/ and read "Best practices for API packages"  https://httr.r-lib.org/articles/api-packages.html. 

Created R wrapper to access repository events https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/#list-repository-events. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
