This subpackage collects information about the recent events of a public git hub repository. It is limited to the past thirty up to nintey days before the function call. This package has four functions: get_git_events, create_events_df, get_events_plots, and git_events_list.

The get_git_events function provides lists of data for a public repository's events. 

The create_events_df function creates a data frame from the output of get_git_events with the following columns: type, actor, payload. 

The get_events_plots function creates two plots. The first plot is a histogram of event type. The second is a histogram of payload.
